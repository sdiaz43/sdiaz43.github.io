				<h2>Majestic Skies</h2>
				<h3>City Skies</h3>

				<p>
					People are not able to see the beauty in skies, they are not able to see what is in fornt of them. This category brings life and emotion to the simple characterisitcs that make up the living environment in which people seem to take a short glimpse and not cherish the amazingness. This is the city and my own experiences category, presenting many images that seem to have described the habitat many of us humans were born in. depicted in these images are rose touches that kiss the sun which help reinforces the mood of relaxation.

					<h4>Natural Sundown</h4>
					
					<p>
						The most anticipated place where people attend during the summer, an activity that creates many memories, good or bad. Towards the end of the day if you stay long enought the sun sets to say it's goodbye and leaves one part of the world with it's warm kiss goodnight. The way nature combines with its other parts to create such a beautiful scheme.
